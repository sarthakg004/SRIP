# IIT Gandhinagar Summer Research Internship Program (SRIP) Selection Task Solution

## Introduction
This repository contains my solution for the selection task of the **IIT Gandhinagar Summer Research Internship Program (SRIP)**. The task involved solving a problem using data-driven techniques, demonstrating proficiency in machine learning, deep learning, and data preprocessing.

## Repository Structure
- `cleaned_solution.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the full solution, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `README.md` - Documentation of the project.

## Methodology
The solution follows these key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and encoding the dataset to make it suitable for training.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features and applying necessary transformations.
3. **Model Training**: Implementing machine learning/deep learning models to solve the given task.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Results & Conclusion**: Interpreting results and drawing meaningful conclusions.

## Requirements
To run this solution, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To execute the notebook:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cleaned_solution.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce results.

## Results
